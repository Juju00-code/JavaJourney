Java Reflections enables the examination as well as modification of fields and methods of
classes and interfaces


1. Reflections allowed the viewing fields of a class.
2. Reflections allowed the viewing methods of a class.
3. Reflections allowed the changing of final variable value.
4.Reflectiona allowed the use of private static methods.
5. Some private fields affect how methods in that class work reflections come in handy in solving that issues.


Downsides
1.Can break code especially when methods called using reflections are changed in their class.
2.Due to executing at runtime it cannot do compiletime optimizations.
